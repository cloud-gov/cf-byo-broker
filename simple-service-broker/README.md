## Prerequisites

In order to complete the tutorial, please be sure you have:

* A working knowledge of Cloud Foundry with experience using the [CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/). You should have familiarity with pushing apps and creating/binding service instances.
* A Cloud Foundry account and a space to deploy apps.  You need the `SpaceDeveloper` role in the space. You will only need 128M of memory available.
* You do not need any additional IaaS resources (such as Azure or GCP)

Before you begin, please be sure you are logged into a Cloud Foundry instance and targeted to an org and space.

## What is a Service Broker?

A service broker is an application that implements a standard API, the [Open Service Broker API](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/). Service brokers hide the complexity of provisioning and configuring the underlying service behind a standard API. In Cloud Foundry terms, this means you can do things like create a database using a standard command `cf create-service`, rather than needing to know how to install and configure the database. And because the API is an industry standard, it can be used in platforms other than Cloud Foundry including Kubernetes.

Service brokers are behind all of the services listed in the marketplace. In this tutorial, we will show you how add your own service broker to the marketplace. The services you see in the marketplace now are likely installed and configured by the administrators of your Cloud Foundry. However, if you are SpaceDeveloper, you can bring your own space-scoped broker. This tutorial will show you how to do this.

## Deploying a Service Broker as an App

A service broker is an application that implements a RESTful API, the [Open Service Broker API](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/). Brokers can be deployed anywhere as long as the Cloud Foundry instance (specifically the Cloud Controller) can reach it via HTTPS. Because our broker is a stateless app and Cloud Foundry is the best platform for stateless apps, we will deploy our broker as an app to Cloud Foundry.

* Download the [simple-service-broker.zip](http://18f.artifacts.rscale.io.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/simple-service-broker.zip) and unzip it. Change to the unzipped `simple-service-broker` directory. Inside is a very simple service broker written in Go along with a Cloud Foundry manifest.

* Change to the unzipped directory and use the supplied manifest to deploy the application. You can either add the `--random-route` flag to the push command to try to prevent route collisions or specify your own hostname with the `-n` flag.

  ```
  $ cf push --random-route
  ```

  If everything is successful you should see output similar to:

  ```
  name:              simple-service-broker
  requested state:   started
  routes:            simple-service-broker-humble-wallaby.app.cloud.gov
  last uploaded:     Mon 14 Jan 12:51:03 MST 2019
  stack:             cflinuxfs2
  buildpacks:        go

  type:            web
  instances:       1/1
  memory usage:    128M
  start command:   ./bin/simple-service-broker
       state     since                  cpu    memory          disk           details
  #0   running   2019-01-14T19:51:09Z   0.0%   11.2M of 128M   9.3M of 256M   
  ```

* Make note of the route created as you will need this in the next step. In the above example it is `simple-service-broker-humble-wallaby.app.cloud.gov`. Your route will differ.

> Note: We are using `random-route` to help prevent route collisions.  You should not use this feature except in development, training or CI/CD scenarios such as this. We do not recommend using `random-route` in production.

### Checking Your Work

You can verify the broker application is running with `cf apps`. You should see output similar to:

  ```
  name                    requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls
  simple-service-broker   started           1/1         128M     256M   simple-service-broker-humble-wallaby.app.cloud.gov
  ```

### Accessing the Catalog

If you have `curl` (or another REST client) installed, you can access the broker's catalog via the `/v2/catalog` endpoint. This is the same endpoint used to populate the marketplace.

* You can curl your endpoint using `curl -s -u admin -H "X-Broker-API-Version: 2.14" https://<YOUR-BROKER-ROUTE>/v2/catalog`. You will be prompted to provide the password which is `secret`. You will see output similar to:

  ```
  {
    "services": [
      {
        "id": "simple-service",
        "name": "simple-service",
        "description": "This service is for demonstration purposes. The same broker could advertise more than one service.",
        "bindable": true,
        "plan_updateable": false,
        "plans": [
          {
            "id": "simple-service-plan-1",
            "name": "simple-service-plan-1",
            "description": "This is plan. Plans can be used to create tiers or levels of service. For example, plans could be used to provide different amounts of cpu, memory, capacity, number of concurrent connections, network performance, etc.",
            "free": true,
            "bindable": true
          },
          {
            "id": "simple-service-plan-2",
            "name": "simple-service-plan-2",
            "description": "This is another plan. Perhaps the service instance created according this plan has more capacity or capability than simple-service-plan-1.",
            "free": true,
            "bindable": true
          }
        ],
        "metadata": {
          "displayName": "simple-service"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

Let's break down the request:

* Service Brokers in Cloud Foundry are protected by basic authentication (i.e. they require a username and password to be supplied). This broker has a default username of `admin` and password of `secret`.
  * The `-u` flag allows you to specify the username which in our case is `admin`.
  * The `-s` flag asks `curl` to prompt you for a password. `curl` does allow you to specify the password as part of the command. However if you used that flag, the password would end up in your terminal history. It is best to get in the habit of not putting passwords into commands.
* The `-H` flag allows you to specify a header and value.  The `X-Broker-API-Version` header must be sent with the request. This header allows service brokers to reject requests from platforms for versions they do not support. The value corresponds to the version Open Service Broker API.

You will see this broker exposes a single service called `simple-service` which offers two plans (or tiers) `simple-service-plan-1` and `simple-service-plan-2`. More on this later.

> NOTE: `jq` (https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is a very helpful utility that can parse and format JSON output. To view the output of our curl request in a more human friendly format, you can pipe the output of the `curl` into `jq`: `curl -s -u admin -H "X-Broker-API-Version: 2.14" https://<YOUR-BROKER-ROUTE>/v2/catalog | jq`

## Registering a Space-Scoped Broker

Once the broker application is running, we can register it as a service broker with Cloud Foundry. If you are a Cloud Foundry admin, you can register a broker and make it available system wide. These brokers are referred to as `standard brokers`. However, if you aren't an admin you can still register a broker within a space provided you have the `SpaceDeveloper` role. These brokers are referred to as `space-scoped brokers`

> More information on roles in Cloud Foundry is availble here: https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/roles.html.

### Space-Scoped Broker Names

Service brokers are assigned names in Cloud Foundry. Just like with applications and service instances, these names are only used internally within Cloud Foundry to reference the respective entity. They have no meaning outside of Cloud Foundry. Applications and service instance names are scoped to a space. To illustrate this scope, two different applications could be deployed to two different spaces and both have the same name (such as `my-app`).

Currently, Cloud Foundry has a limitation whereby the name of a space-scoped service broker must be unique. **This is a known limitation that is being addressed by the development teams.** To get around this limitation, we recommend adding the org and space as part of the name assigned to your broker. You will see these denoted as `<YOUR_ORG>` and `<YOUR_SPACE>` below.

* Use the `create-service-broker` command to register your broker with Cloud Foundry.

  ```
  $ cf create-service-broker --space-scoped simple-service-broker-<YOUR_ORG>-<YOUR_SPACE> admin secret https://<YOUR-BROKER-ROUTE> 
  ```

  You should see output similar to:

  ```
  Creating service broker simple-service-broker-18f-development in org 18f / space development as someuser@cloud.gov...
  OK
  ```

Let's break down the command:

  * `--space-scoped`: This tells Cloud Foundry to register the broker only within your space. This allows you to add any broker to your space.
  * `simple-service-broker-<YOUR_ORG>-<YOUR_SPACE>`: This is the name of the broker as referenced within Cloud Foundry. While this matches our app name, there is no relationship between the two values. Using the same name simply makes it easier for humans to reason over the relationship.
  * `admin` and `secret` are the `USERNAME` & `PASSWORD` for the service broker. Providing these allows Cloud Foundry to authenticate to the broker.
  * `https://<YOUR-BROKER-ROUTE>`: This is the route of your broker prefixed with `https://`.
 
#### Checking Your Work

At this point, your broker should be registered with Cloud Foundry.  You can check this by running via the `cf service-brokers` command.  You should see output similar to:

  ```
  Getting service brokers as someuser@cloud.gov...

  name            url
  simple-service-broker-18f-development   https://simple-service-broker-humble-wallaby.app.cloud.gov
  ```

## Viewing the Marketplace

At this point, your new service called `simple-service` should show up in the marketplace along side the other services.

> NOTE: Because this is a space-scoped broker, it will only show up in the marketplace in the space or spaces which it is registered.

### Viewing the Marketplace in the CLI

You can see this via the CLI or using the Stratos UI.

* Run `cf marketplace` using the CLI. Within the marketplace, you should see your broker:

  ```
  $ cf marketplace
  Getting services from marketplace in org 18f / space development as someuser@cloud.gov...
  OK

  service                         plans

  simple-service                simple-service-plan-1, simple-service-plan-2

  ```

> NOTE: You are seeing the same service and plans as you saw accessing the broker via `curl` above (if you completed that optional portion of the tutorial). This information is populated from the same `/v2/catalog` endpoint.  

### Viewing the Marketplace in the Stratos UI

You should also see your service listed in the Stratos UI.

* Open your Stratos console and navigate to the marketplace. Be sure you have selected your org and space.  You should see the `simple-service` listed.

![Stratos Marketplace showing simple-service](img/stratos-marketplace.png "Stratos Marketplace")

## Beyond the Simple Service Broker

At this point, you should be able to create and bind service instances as with any other service in the marketplace. Of course our simple broker isn't really brokering anything as there is no backing service. Therefore our instances aren't terribly useful. But we can use them to practice a few things.

### Using the Same Broker in Another Space

You can use the same broker in another space without redeploying it. You can simply register the same broker in another space using `cf create-service-broker`. The space does not need to be in the same org.

Because of the limitation on broker names documented [above](#space-scoped-broker-names), you will need to provide a unique name to the `cf create-service-broker` command. However, if you follow the recommended workaround of adding the org and space, it should all work for you.

> NOTE: This is optional. If you only have access to one space, you won't be able to do this.

* Target another space

  ```
  $ cf target -s <ANOTHER_SPACE>
  ```

* Register the same service broker using a different name (but the same username, password and URL)

  ```
  $ cf create-service-broker --space-scoped simple-service-broker-<YOUR_ORG>-<YOUR_SPACE> admin secret https://<YOUR-BROKER-ROUTE>
  ```

You should now have access to the broker in this space.

* Run `cf marketplace` using the CLI. Within the marketplace, you should see your broker:

  ```
  $ cf marketplace
  Getting services from marketplace in org 18f / space <ANOTHER_SPACE> as someuser@cloud.gov...
  OK

  service                         plans

  simple-service                simple-service-plan-1, simple-service-plan-2

  ```

### Purging Service Instances

While our broker is quite simple, other brokers will bring their own complexity. This is often because each broker will often require specific configuration to connect with the backing services. We can use the simple broker to learn some helpful hints on dealing with more complex brokers.

#### Creating and Binding an Instance

First, let's create a service instance. Make sure you are in the space where the simple-service-broker is deployed, as
it is used in this portion of the tutorial.

* Use `cf create-service` to create a service instance.

  ```
  $ cf create-service simple-service simple-service-plan-1 simple-service-instance
  Creating service instance simple-service-instance in org 18f / space development as someuser@cloud.gov...
  OK
  ```

* Use `cf services` to verify we have created an instance:

  ```
  $ cf services
  Getting services in org 18f / space development as someuser@cloud.gov...

  name                      service          plan                    bound apps   last operation
  simple-service-instance   simple-service   simple-service-plan-1                create succeeded
  ```

Now, let's bind it. We aren't looking to use the service, so it doesn't matter what app we bind it to. Therefore, rather than deploy another app, we can bind it to the app we have: the simple-service-broker.

* Use `cf bind-service` to bind the instance to the simple-service-broker.

  ```
  $ cf bind-service simple-service-broker simple-service-instance
  ```

  While the CLI will prompt you to restage the app, you don't need to do this since the app won't do anything with the service.

* You can see the credentials returned by the simple-service-broker by inspecting the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable:

  ```
  $ cf env simple-service-broker
  Getting env variables for app simple-service-broker in org 18f / space development as someuser@cloud.gov...
  OK

  System-Provided:
  {
   "VCAP_SERVICES": {
    "simple-service": [
     {
      "binding_name": null,
      "credentials": "{\"url\": \"https://simple-service.example.com\"}",
      "instance_name": "simple-service-instance",
      "label": "simple-service",
      "name": "simple-service-instance",
      "plan": "simple-service-plan-1",
      "provider": null,
      "syslog_drain_url": null,
      "tags": [],
      "volume_mounts": []
     }
    ]
   }
  }
  ```

#### Purging Service Instances and Bindings

If you find yourself iterating on broker deployments, it may be helpful at times to purge service instances or bindings. Imagine if your broker became unavailable or returned errors after you had already created service instances or service bindings. The Cloud Foundry database would still have a record of the instances and the bindings. Your attempts to delete them using `cf delete-service` or `cf unbind-service` will fail as the broker won't be available. This is what `cf purge-service-instance` is for.

As the CLI warns:

*"WARNING: This operation assumes that the service broker responsible for this service instance is no longer available or is not responding with a 200 or 410, and the service instance has been deleted, leaving orphan records in Cloud Foundry's database. All knowledge of the service instance will be removed from Cloud Foundry, including service bindings and service keys."*

`purge-service-instance` will delete a service instance and bindings. We can simulate a broker failure to test this command.

* Stop your simple-service-broker

  ```
  $ cf stop simple-service-broker
  Stopping app simple-service-broker in org 18f / space development as someuser@cloud.gov...
  OK
  ```

* Try to unbind the service instance from the app.  It will fail.

  ```
  $ cf unbind-service simple-service-broker simple-service-instance
  Unbinding app simple-service-broker from service simple-service-instance in org 18f / space development as someuser@cloud.gov...
  Unexpected Response

  CC code:       0

      "method": "DELETE",
      "status": 404
    }
  }

  FAILED
  ```

  Using `cf delete-service` will also fail as the broker is unavailable.

* If you run `cf services` you will see that Cloud Foundry still has the service instance and binding.

  ```
  $ cf services
  Getting services in org 18f / space development as sgreenberg@rscale.io...

  name                      service          plan                    bound apps              last operation
  simple-service-instance   simple-service   simple-service-plan-1   simple-service-broker   create succeeded
  ```

  We need to purge the instance and binding from Cloud Foundry.

* Use `cf purge-service-instance` to delete the instance and binding from Cloud Foundry.

  ```
  $ cf purge-service-instance -f simple-service-instance
  Purging service simple-service-instance...
  OK
  ```

* Re-run `cf services` to verify it has been purged.

  ```
  $ cf services
  Getting services in org 18f / space development as someuser@cloud.gov...

  No services found
  ```

You should only use `purge-service-instance` when `cf unbind-service` and/or `cf delete-service` fail and you cannot fix the broker. Note that you may also have to clean up backing resources left behind.

### Purging Service Offerings

What if you want to purge all instances, bindings and service offerings in the marketplace related to a broker that is no longer functional? You can do this with `cf purge-service-offering`. Of course, this is also a last resort and should only be used when the broker is unavailable or non-functional.

As the warning in the CLI states:

*"WARNING: This operation assumes that the service broker responsible for this service offering is no longer available, and all service instances have been deleted, leaving orphan records in Cloud Foundry's database. All knowledge of the service will be removed from Cloud Foundry, including service instances and service bindings. No attempt will be made to contact the service broker; running this command without destroying the service broker will cause orphan service instances. After running this command you may want to run either delete-service-auth-token or delete-service-broker to complete the cleanup."*

* Purge the `simple-service` offering

  ```
  $ cf purge-service-offering -f simple-service
  ```

  You will see output similar to:

  ```
  Purging service simple-service...
  OK
  ```

If you re-run `cf marketplace` and `cf services` you will see all of the `simple-service` records are gone.

## Updating a Broker

What happens if we release a new version of the simple service broker? What should you do to update the broker in your space?

Remember that the broker is simply an application. From Cloud Foundry's perspective, the broker is just an endpoint - a url and some credentials. Therefore, you only need to push the updated app. You don't need to re-run `create-service-broker` or do anything with your existing service instances.

Here are some things to consider when managing broker instances:

* We recommend updating any Cloud Foundry app using either a [blue/green deployment](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/blue-green.html) or the new [zero downtime](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/zero-downtime.html) capability currently in beta.
* The broker is only involved in provisioning/de-provisioning and binding/unbinding. It is not involved when an application interacts with the service instance. Therefore, if you chose to simply push new changes, there is a fairly low risk of an interruption during the push. Users will simply not be able to provision or bind.
* Updates assume the broker has been authored and tested to not introduce breaking changes. You should always test new versions in a non-production environment before incorporating them into production workflows.


## Deleting the Broker

When you are done with it, you can clean up by deleting the service broker and the application.

* Delete the service broker:

  ```
  $ cf delete-service-broker -f simple-service-broker-<YOUR_ORG>-<YOUR_SPACE>
  ```

  You will see output similar to:

  ```
  Deleting service broker simple-service-broker-18f-development as someuser@cloud.gov...
  OK
  ```

  Remember to do this in every space where you registered the broker.

* Delete the broker application:

  ```
  $ cf delete -f simple-service-broker
  ```

## Beyond the Tutorial

* This simple tutorial is designed to introduce you to the concepts and commands related to space-scoped brokers. We recommend you next try to deploy a functional broker by following the [Google Spanner Tutorial](../gcp-service-broker).

* You can build your own service brokers by implementing the API. Libraries exist in many languages like Spring and GO that allow you to quickly build new brokers. More information is available: [Open Service Broker API](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/).

* The good folks at Stark and Wayne maintain a tool called [eden](https://github.com/Qarik-Group/eden). Eden is a command line client for Open Service Broker API compliant brokers. It is very useful in developing and troubleshooting brokers.
